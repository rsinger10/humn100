                  Brief - Memoir of our late happily
                  departed <persName>Sister Esther Latrobe</persName> drawn
                  up by her Husband and Brother </p>
                  
                  <p>Our late dear Relative was born at <placeName>Bristol</placeName>
                  June the 7th 1802, and being the only daughter
                  among a family of six children, was peculiar
                  ly precious to her parents and brothers, and tenderly
                  beloved by them.</p> 
                  
                  <p>This tender affection and endearment
                  was always returned by her with a warmth
                  of feeling, which evinced to her family, her
                  deep attachment towards them, and the gra-
                  titude heart to them for their love.</p> 
                  
                  <p>She was very early subject of sickness
                  and pain. In her childhood by occasion of the
                  measles, which struck into her chest, she was
                  brought to the brink of the grave and her fami
                  ly and medical attendants at that time had
                  lost all hope of her life. It pleased the
                  Lord, however to manifest in her case, His
                  Power as the Preserver of man, and her life
               </p>

               <p>
                  was redeemed from destruction. At this period
                  already, the grace of the Lord Jesus was producing
                  in her conduct the buddings of that patient
                  endurance of suffering, which was afterward
                  exhibited in blossom and in fruit. Her meek
                  submission under pain was a wonder to many,
                  and her physician frequently expressed his 
                  astonishment, that a child of her tender
                  frame and years, would exhibit such lamb-
                  like patience, under the pain he knew
                  she was enduring. When she was just 
                  eleven years old, she experienced another 
                  severe trial from the hand of the Lord, by
                  the death of her dear Mother. In common
                  with the other member's of her father's
                  house, she felt this bereavement keenly, and
                  often wept in after-life at the remem-
                  brance of her loss. Indeed the loss was in 
                  some respect peculiar to her, as a daughter,
                  and the only one; -- yet the Lord graciously made
                  it up to her, as she felt and feelingly 
                  acknowledged, by the fond cares of those whom
                  he still left her, and by the kindness of many
                  kindness dear friends, not immediately
               </p>

               <p>    
                  belonging to her own family. 
               </p>
                  
                  <p>She spent the years of her schooling
                  partly in <placeName>Bristol</placeName> under the care of <persName>Sister Bird</persName>
                  and subsequently at <placeName>Tytherton</placeName>. The latter
                  place was very dear to her; where she lived
                  a great and interesting part of her pilgrim--
                  age, and there she found rest to her soul in the 
                  atoning merit of her Saviour. </p>
                  
                  <p><persName>Brother and Sister West</persName> were as parents 
                  to her, and she became the intimate friend of 
                  their eldest daughter. This was an attach-
                  ment formed and maintained in the Lord, and
                  we have reason to believe that our dear
                  Relative often and frequently felt is to be for 
                  her good, a strengthening of her hands in
                  God. During these years, she was brought
                  again to the verge of eternity, by means of 
                  a rheumatic fever, and a violent affection or 
                  palpitation of the heart. Again did her medi-
                  cal attendants give her up and her sorrowing 
                  friends despaired of her life, but yet once more
                  was the Lord's hand stretched forth to save 
                  her, and she was restored to her family.</p>

               <p>                
                  They received her again as one raised from the
                  dead, and she consequently became still more
                  dear and precious to them all. These alarming 
                  sicknesses were evidently blessed to her soul,
                  they were means and times of grace to her.</p>
                  
                  <p>She was led to search and try her ways, and to 
                  seek the Lord with full purpose of heart 
                  and he was graciously found of her. Knowing
                  now the end of our dear relative, we can trace
                  clearly the good hand of our Lord in all these
                  dispensations; we can see how he purified
                  her, and made her fit for his service, and meet
                  for an early possession of the inheritance
                  incorruptible and undefiled, and that fadeth
                  not away. We are enabled to read and to des --
                  cribe exactly the state of her heart; for she 
                  has felt behind her, in writing, a few of those
                  meditations and prayers, in which doubtless
                  she often engaged, under the eye alone of
                  her unseen Friend. She writes under 
                  date of Tytherton - May 12th, 1824: --
                  "_May this year be remembered by me, 
                  as long as my gracious Creator permits

                  I have been an unprofitable servant.

                  who ask his forgiveness, and put their

                  August 17th.-- She says-- Lord I must
                  blushing stand when considering what an ungrate
                  -ful creature I am. How often the means thou
                  hast appointed for worshipping Thee, have been
                  neglected by me. I do indeed attend at thy house
                  of prayer, but with such a wavering heart, and
                  indeed sometimes cold indifference, that I
                  return without receiving much benefit to my
                  soul. Do thou, Oh! Heavenly Father, look
                  on me in mercy, forgive all past neglect,
                  make me in every respect more like what
                  a Christian ought to be, more humble, rely-
                  ing only on Thee for everything I need.  Subdue
                  all earthly inclinations. Dear Saviour
                  let me take my soul at the foot of thy cross,
                  for ever having my eyes fixed on thy sacred
                  body, bearing my sins' heavy load. Yes!
                  then let me the chief of sinners, weep and
                  love my life away! Indeed, O God, I must
                  confess that I have rested too much on my
                  own strength; Oh! forgive this presumption,
                  and hear my prayer for the sake of thy dear
                  Son, without whose atonement I dare not
                  approach thy throne. Give me then that
                  true faith, which puts all dependence on 
                  the Creator and not on the creatures. Unto

                  thee. let me look for every thing, for thy guid-
                  ance and direction under all circumstances,
                  in the situation in which thy good provid-
                  ence has placed me. Here I must confess,
                  how short I fall of what I ought to be.
                  How little of my time is engaged with the
                  children under my care, in conversing of 
                  thee and directing their young minds heav-
                  enward. Dear Lord forgive and teach me
                  how to point thee out; let it be my delight 
                  to talk of Thee; and oh! grant, that not one 
                  may leave this house without some im-
                  pression of thy dying love. Oh! that 
                  my heart were more devoted to thy service
                  I often think too much of the future. 
                  On thee dear Saviour, I must defend
                  Do with me what seemeth right to thee, and
                  let my whole course be ordered by thy never 
                  failing power. Thine I am, yes! thine
                  eternally. Let me not by any misconduct,
                  word, or action, ever bring a reproach upon
                  thy followers. When thou seest I am going
                  astray for thy mercy's sake, by any means;
                  which Thou choosest, head me into the right 
                  path, oh!

                  Ah! suffer me not to be a stumbling-
                  block to any person, but may it in my walk be
                  seen, that I with thee have been. These peti-
                  tions an unworthy sinner ventures to ask
                  only through our Mediator and Advocate, Jesus
                  Christ, who died for our transgressions and was
                  bruised for our iniquities; and of this I feel
                  assured: He loveth us unspeakably,
                  Nor lets us pray in vain,
                  But gives the fearful heart that hope
                  Thy suit thou shalt obtain.
                  The next extract which is dated September 6th
                  lets us know, how soon and how kindly the
                  Lord answered her petitions, giving her holy
                  joy in believing. She writes: Jesus is my
                  joy, therefore blest am I. Thy ever gracious
                  Shepherd, how gently hast thou led me into
                  thy fold. Thou hast drawn me with chords
                  of love to Thee, and now thou knowest that my
                  soul delighteth in Thee. I have had kind
                  visits oft from Thee in the night season.
                  Thou hast condescended to assist me in
                  my duties in the day time. Yes! I have
                  often felt thee. Oh dearest Saviour, continue
                  to be near unto me, as the air which constant-
                  ly I breath. Satan does sometimes try to draw

                  perhaps there is no God. But thy long suffer-
                  ing and tender mercies are past expression.
                  How often after such moments, hast Thou
                  drawn me to thyself, so that the language
                  of my heart has been - "I will a little pilgrim
                  be - Resolved alone to follow Thee. Thou Lamb
                  of God who now art gone- Up to thy everlasting
                  throne"- etc. The following expressions of 
                  thankfulness and humble confession, occur under 
                  the same date: Oh! God! Thy goodness to me is
                  past all expression; thy merciful hand has 
                  been over me these many years. How often hast 
                  thou raised me from a bed of sickness, yet how 
                  have I returned thy kindness? I have after a time
                  forgotten- and yet not quite. No thou hast often
                  showed thy great compassions by leading me to 
                  reflect on thy past mercies. Oh! how shall
                  I, the most sinful, due thanksgiving raises-

                  November 28th, we have the following expressions of
                  heart, clearly showing, that the bright hope of
                  immortality, which shed such a glory round her 
                  last few hours, was then already enkindled in 
                  her soul. She writes: "The beloved of the Lord
                  shall dwell in safety by him, and the Lord shall
                  cover him all the day long"- Deut. 33.12.

                  Yes, dear Lord, thou dost indeed had me on
                  in safety and mercy, and what have I deserved
                  Nothing! - I am an unprofitable servant
                  My transgressions are too numerous to count;
                  but I know in whom I have believed, and
                  he is able and willing to keep that which I
                  have committed to him till that great day,
                  when I shall gain permission to leave this
                  mortal tent. Oh! my soul, thou hast had of
                  late sweet converse with thy heavenly Friend;
                  what and if he should call thee to live with Him.
                  "Since He did from death arise,
                  And then ascend victorious,
                  I likewise in the hope rejoice,
                  To raise again more glorious,
                  Thus free from fear I can in peace
                  Depart to see him as he is,
                  And live with him forever!"
                  She then adds: "This is sunday morning,
                  "And I am detained at home through a cold,
                  "however, however I shall attend the last

                  In the early part of the year 1825, she appear,
                  to have been filled with a more entire spirit of
                  devotedness to the Lord, a more ardent desire for his
                  service and for being instrumental towards the
                  spread of His Kingdom. She had before this
                  period engaged in the service of the Ladies School
                  at Tytherlon, as a teacher, but the following
                  extracts appear to aim at a more direct and
                  spiritual employment in the house of the
                  Lord. March 2nd, 1825- She writes:
                  "The world passeth away and the lust thereof;
                  but he that doeth the will of God abideth forever"
                  "Oh! my soul, think often of this text.

                  of the same year appears to have been a time of trial.
                  She writes, Sep 20th "I am a sinful creature O

                  "childrens, to such as keep his commandment
                  "to do them." Thus beautifully end her
                  notes of the year 1825, - In the Spring
                  of the year 1826, it was proposed to her to
                  remove to Gracehill to be employed as a teach-
                  er in the Ladies Boarding School there.
                  In a letter to her brother then Director of the
                  Schools in that congregation- She thus
                  signified her acceptance of the situation: With
                  diversity of feelings. I this time address you, not
                  that I am undetermined what step to take, on the
                  contrary I am pleased you thought of me. I trust
                  I shall be aided and supported by my unseen Friend,
                  to discharge every duty committed to me, with
                  credit and satisfaction; that I may not become
                  an offence or stumbling stone to any person
                  is my sincere prayer, but may my conduct be
                  such as becomes a follower of Him, who was
                  meek and lowly." She evidently sought
                  the direction of the Lord in this step.

                  and by her manuscript it appears the word of the Lord
                  to Jacob was applied to her own case: "Behold I
                  "will be with thee, and will keep thee in all places
                  "whither thou goest, and will bring thee again into
                  "this land; for I will not leave thee, untill I
                  "have done that which I have spoken to thee
                  "of." ----
                  Her feelings at leaving Tytherton, where she
                  had enjoyed so much grace, she thus expresses in
                  the letter above quoted: "I have now lived in Tyther
                  "-ton 6 years. In this place I have attained my
                  "church priviledges, and received much kindness
                  "from several of its inhabitants, therefore you
                  "will not wonder, that my feelings are some-
                  "what various. I shall always retain sentiment 
                  "of gratitude and respect for many individuals."
                  She arrived in Gracehill about the middle 
                  of June; and spent 3 years and a half, faithfully
                  and usefully employed in the sphere that
                  was allotted her there. It was a season of
                  sweet and gratefully remembered intercourse
                  with her brother and sister, with whom she 
                  spent, not unprofitably, great part of her 
                  spare time, feeling their house to be her
                  home, and giving and receiving that mutual
                  encouragement, which we all feel necessa-
                  ry in our various avocations. A few of

                  state of her mind during this period.
                  Sep. 14th, 1826.  She writes --- "When thou
                  "passest through the waters, I will be with thee, and
                  "through the floods, they shall not overflow thee,

                  "not be burned, neither shall the flames kindle
                  "upon thee." "This does oftimes renew my cour-

                  "build upon this gracious promise, as a rock
                  "which ne'er can shrink, is what my poor
                  "heart doth pant for. Thus to trust unto my

                  "doth magnify the Lord and my spirit hath
                  "rejoiced in God my Saviour." Give me O my hea-

                  "notice me, as to treat me as a child. During
                  "the last year I have indeed been tried in vari-

                  "as thy anointed in the path thou hast for me 
                  "appointed. Save us O <persName>God</persName> of our <orgName>Salvation</orgName>, and

                  "thy holy name , and <name type="emotion">glory</name> in thy praise!"--
                  From the last clause of this prayer, and the
                  peculiar expression, "gather us together," it would
                  appear that her <name type="emotion">affectionate</name> mind was thus
                  <name type="emotion">embracing</name> in its desires before <persName>God</persName>, all the mem
                  bers of her family. May her <name type="emotion">fervent petitions</name> be
                  most graciously answered.  The last meditation
                  she has left is dated <date>June 16th 1829</date>, and it
                  clearly shows how the <persName>Lord</persName> was preparing 
                  her mind for that important change in life,
                  which took place with her before the end of the 
                  year. She writes, -- "To thee O heavenly 
                  "<persName>Father</persName>, I <name type="emotion">desire</name> to submit all my desires, and

                  eloquently declare <persName>God's</persName> glory and speak 
                  <persName>His</persName> praise. This was a favourite consi-
                  deration with her. She <name type="emotion">admired</name> the beau-

                  She concludes thus: "And should man
                  be mute, after receiving so many benefits?
                  Undoubtedly not. He should lead the chorus.
                  Each breath should sound forth the praises
                  of so blessed and adorable a friend. May thy

                  sense of her <name type="emotion">unworthiness</name> <name type="event">to be employed 
                  as a handmaid of the <persName>Lord</persName></name>. By her chris-

                  <persName>God</persName>, and implicit trust in his kind lead-

                  his official duties, especially when those 
                  duties led over thorny paths: her <name type="emotion">love</name> of
                  spiritual converse and family devotion too,
                  and her <name type="emotion">interest</name> in the welfare of the Congre-
                  gation, were calculated to increase that love
                  to the Saviour and his people which not only 
                  sweetens the cup of life, but is essential to 
                  the usefulness of the Lords servants. She
                  <name type="emotion">loved</name> to see and welcome those <persName>Brethren and Sisters</persName>

                  her conversation proved to be a blessing and a <name type="emotion">comfort</name>.
                  Although no longer engaged in the education
                  of children, yet that <name type="emotion">love</name> to the lambs of the
                  flock, which characterises many of her pri-
                  vate meditations, was undiminished. 
                  Remembering the blessings she had experienc-
                  ed when taken in early life, by her parents
                  to the children's meetings at <placeName>Bristol</placeName>, and
                  also the impression, which the remarks and 
                  advice of her beloved father had made upon
                  her youthful mind, she felt a <name type="emotion">strong int-
                  trest</name> in behalf of the children of this
                  congregation, and impelled by that interest, 
                  she accompanied her husband to the house-
                  es of all the parents, previous to the children's 
                  Festival, although by no means well at the 
                  time. The weighty and affectionate words and 
                  expostulations she employed on that occasion 
                  as a consequence of that visit, was, the 
                  recommencement of meetings for the child-
                  ren of the Congregation which had been for
                  some time discontinued. She was <name type="emotion">peculiar

                  struggle, and she often mingled her tears with those 
                  of her husband, while he was engaged in visit-
                  ing the boy on his sickbed. Sabbaths were
                  days of special <name type="emotion">delight</name> to her; she <name type="emotion">loved</name> the 
                  assembly of the <persName>Lords</persName> people, whither public 
                  or private, often prolonging the subjects that 
                  had been treated of in private conversation,
                  and expressing her gratitude for the abundant 
                  provision of <persName>Gods</persName> house. Even when indispo-
                  sed in body, and gently urged to stay at home, 
                  she often said, in allusion to her approach-
                  ing confinement. No I will go to the <persName>Lord's</persName> house 
                  while I can you know I shall soon be deprived
                  of that privilege for a considerable time."
                  The event, which she thus alluded to, natural-
                  ly led her to frequent meditation and converse,
                  on the possibility of its terminating in her 
                  <name type="emotion">dissolution</name>, and some months ago, she expres-
                  sed her <name type="emotion">conviction</name>, that if the <persName>Lord</persName> should
                  see fit to make it the occasion of her change
                  coming, all would be well; she could meet 
                  her <persName>Saviour</persName> with <name type="emotion">joy</name> as a pardoned sinner,
                  who had nothing to boast, but whose <name type="emotion">trust</name> was
                  in his atonement and righteousness. Such an

                  expression of her <name type="emotion">sentiment</name> was especially elicited
                  by the sudden departure and burial of <persName>sister Morton</persName>
                  when walking with her husband in the peace-
                  ful spot, where her own dear remains were in-
                  terred but 3 weeks after, in hope of a <name type="emotion">joyful</name>
                  resurrection. The kindness and cordiality mani-
                  fested towards her and her husband, both by our 
                  own <persName>Brethren and Sisters</persName> and by many excellent friends,
                  was <name type="emotion">gratefully</name> felt by her. On this subject and 
                  on the general state of her mind, she thus 
                  wrote to her sister in <placeName>Gracehill</placeName>, in the <date>latter
                  part of June</date>: "I might charge myself with

                  As the time of her confinement approached,
                  she stayed her mind calmly on the Lord, neither
                  giving way to needless fears, nor yet elated? with 
                  too sanguine hopes. She found the letter and 
                  advice of her dear father a great help to her,
                  truly valuing the privilege of having relatives,
                  who were bound to her by the double ties of 
                  nature and of grace. Thus prepared in her 
                  mind, the time of her trial came, and after a 
                  long, difficult, and painful labour of 4 days,
                  she was enabled to become the mother of a fine, 
                  healthy boy, early on the morning of Friday
                  15th Oct. During this severe trivial
                  She manifested that patience which had so long
                  characterized her, and was really an edification
                  to those who were around her. She constantly
                  noticed the text of the day, drawing much com-
                  fort and support from them. This was especially

                  Sr Borland, to whom she was deservedly attach
                  ed, of the Lord's kindness to her from her ear-
                  first infancy, in caring for her, hedging up her
                  way, keeping her from temptation, and guiding her
                  gently by the streams of salvation, and in the 
                  green pastures of his love. She spoke also 
                  of the happiness and profit she had derived,
                  from her connection with the Bretherands Church,
                  Indeed she sincerely loved this part of the 
                  Lord's vineyard, as is plain from her manuscript
                  which contains meditations on some memorial
                  days of our church, and petitions on behalf of 
                  some of its members. She passed the friday 
                  very favourably, and though she did not sleep much
                  during the night, her medical attendant expres
                  sed this satisfaction at her state on saturday
                  morning, and declared he did not expect to find her
                  so well. About the middle of the day, however,
                  unfavorable symptoms appeared, which did
                  not yield to the remedies applied, and when her
                  physician came again in the morning eve
                  ning, he recognized the marks of rapid and decided
                  inflammation. Powerful means were used to

                  impede its progress and anxiously was the effect awaited; 
                  yet still the symptoms increased. She often reproved the
                  anxiety of those around her, and scarcely repressed her
                  tears, bidding them not to cast away their confi-
                  dence. After a lapse of two hours, still stronger
                  means were resorted to, as a final hope, and her
                  husband proposing that they should unite in
                  beseeching the blessing of the Lord for her
                  restoration, she expressed her desire that this
                  should be alone; begging him at the same time
                  not to weep, for she was in the Lord's hands,
                  He had often raised her up for when brought low,
                  and could do it again if He pleased. All were
                  now composed after prayer, and the dear sufferer
                  being asked if she were resigned to the Lord's will,
                  whatever it might be, replied cheerfully, "Yes I am."
                  Shortly after, she added with great emphasis:
                  "Oh! what pround hearts we have; this is
                  sent to humble one, and if I am brought through;
                  I shall walk more humbly with my God." 
                  Observing the tears of those about her, she
                  endeavoured to comfort them, told them not to
                  weep for her sake for it disturbed her composure

                  and proceeded to say: "I had once to seek my Saviour,
                  "when in this state, but not now. I know he 
                  "will do all things well!" During the night
                  some of the symptoms abated, though the most
                  alarming continued. She became very heavy,
                  slept, and wandered occasionally in her mind, yes
                  always in an edifying way. Early in the morn
                  ing her medical attendant came, felt her
                  pulse, shook her head, and upon having her 
                  loom, informed her husband, that all hope of
                  her life was now gone, mortification had
                  commenced, and that day would be her last. 
                  With a bleeding and agonised heart, yet with 
                  prayer for the Divine support, he immediate
                  ly returned to the bedside of his dying wife,
                  to hear, what I may have to tell you?' Though 
                  she had appeared almost insensible before, she
                  seemed to understand him in a moment, looked 
                  astonished, and then with the utmost composure
                  and firmness said: "Yes my dear I am! Having fun
                  informed of the Doctor's opinions respecting her,
                  she exclaimed with peace in her countenance;
                  Well - the Lord's will be done - the Lord's will is
                  always best. I had hoped to have been spared a little

                  little longer, but I am resigned to my Saviour's will."
                  a pause insued, a period of sobs and tears, "Don't cry for
                  me" she said, "I am happy going to our Saviour",
                  Turning to her husband, she said: "The Lord will sup-
                  port you and bless you, and be far more to you than I have
                  been. We have been very happy together, but now you
                  "must give me up to the Lord. Don't weep." and then
                  she looked up with glory in her countenance, and 
                  exclaimed; "O the delights, the heavenly joys, --
                  "The glories of the place - Where Jesus sheds the
                  brightest beams -- Of his o'erflowing grace." --
                  and who would not go there" Every thing like
                  wandering or insensibility had now completely felt 
                  her. She seemed to realize, in the body, the joys
                  that were before her, and her bedside became the very
                  gate of heaven. It was as though the place were
                  surrounded by happy spirits and holy angels, waiting
                  to receive her redeemed soul, when it should be uncloth-
                  ed. Her husband being called out for a moment, she
                  took that opportunity to say to Sister Borland;" Ask Brother
                  Kleinsmith to write to Brother Ramftler and like my
                  dear Father, that I am departing in hope of a 
                  "joyful resurrection, and am going to be committed to my

                  uplifted to heaven, and oh! for angels to waft me to
                  that happy place!" -- feeling then for her dear husband, she
                  said to Sister Borland, who was weeping - "Don't cry before
                  "him, it grieves him." Being asked upon her hus
                  bands return, if she would see a young friend, who
                  was waiting to speak to her, she replied: "Oh! yes
                  send for her, let her come while I can speak." As soon
                  as she had come to the bedside, the dying patient grasp
                  ed her hand and said: "O my dear, you must come out
                  of the world and leave its vanities and attend to the salva
                  tion of your soul. I know it is hard to leave the
                  world, but you must do it, if you would have hope in
                  your death, when you are like me." She said more
                  to the same purpose, and directed her to the Lord Jesus,
                  and when the young lady promised to be kind to her
                  baby. - she said - Oh! I have given up my ??
                  it will be well cared for, but, (and she put dying em-
                  phases into the words) oh! do care for your own
                  salvation." - Another lady of decided Christian 
                  harmeter approaching, she helped her, and said: "The
                  steadfast, unmoveable, always abounding in the
                  "work of the Lord" Frequently did she say to sister 
                  Borland, who had been day and night at her bedside:
                  "Oh! you have been very, very kind to me - the Lord will

                  tation, she asked what day it was, &amp; being bold it was 
                  the sabbath day, she explained with amimation: "Oh!
                  it is a blessed thing to die on the sabbath, and no enter
                  into an eternal sabbath."----   Shortly after it was 
                  proposed to sing with her; she said: oh! you! do"----
                  and being asked to choose a verse, she gave out:
                  "O then the sole defence and aid and but owing to the
                  indistinctness of her voice only a few words were gath-
                  ered and being it could not be found at the hine. The foll-
                  owing was then selected: Jesus at my dispolution and     "
                  when she said, "yes that will do." It was then hardly
                  sang and partly sang out, but she maintained a hea--
                  venly composure, and often begged those around her 
                  not to weep for her, for she was happy. Once or twice 
                  she said, "perhaps the Doctor is mistaken. I am 
                  too strong to die, I do not feel as if I were dying."
                  But about two hours and a half before her departure 
                  she said placidly: "Now I feel a change, it will not
                  be long now."      and then she betook herself again to
                  comfort those around her, &amp; especially her sorrowing
                  partner. To him she said, with tender affection:
                  "the lord will support you &amp; supply all your wants,
                  I know he will, for I have prayed for you"---  He replies
                  "yes my dear I know he will, but it is hard to part
                  with you so soon."----"O! yes,"she answered, it is hard

                  Doctor who was greatly interested about her, entered
                  the room, when she eagerly addressed him: "How 
                  "long shall I live Doctor? He seemed much affected,
                  &amp; replied: "My dear Mrs. Lattrobe, I am sorry to say 
                  "you cannot be long."   "Sorry! she said, sorry--- do not 
                  say sorry. I am glad. Will it be two hours?" He 
                  answered that it could not be much longer, &amp; that 
                  he was happy to see her so resigned: when she
                  explained: "Let me die the death of the righ-
                  teous, &amp; let my last end be like his! " here mom-
                  ents were now spent in sacred prayer, &amp; in com-
                  forting the survivors, but in a short time the 
                  struggle of death became hard, though they
                  were not severe, &amp; she said "it is a hard work to
                  die"---&amp; several times, asked, "will it be long?"
                  she was told it probably would not, but that the 
                  Lord would give her strength equal to her day.
                  This seemed to satisfy her, foron being asked, 
                  whether a prayer should be made for her release 
                  she said: "No! no! the Lords time is best, I can 
                  wait patiently for that"--- 'Yes' said she- though

                  then with great earnestness, &amp; peace in her looks, she
                  repeated the verse: "Now I have found the ground 
                  "where in-- Sure my souls anchor may remain;--
                  Even Christ, who to atone for sin,---Was as a

                  She now signified, that she wished to take leave of
                  the friends saying,, "Goodbye--- Farewell to you all,"---
                  waving her hands, &amp; repeating the words, when
                  some seemed to linger. Being then left alone, with
                  her husband &amp; sister Borland, she held their 
                  hand most affectionately, &amp; comforted their hearts 
                  saying to sister Borland," you will be you to him: I

                  He was deeply affected, and with much emotion, pro-
                  nounced over her the blessing of the Lord for her 
                  disfortune. at the dove of it she said: amen! amen

                  "yes! a stingliss death." words, which the emphat-
                  ically repeated several times. She now appeared 
                  once more to gather a little strength, again expres-
                  sed her gratitude to Sister  Borland, adding "you
                  "will be good to my child"---- &amp; again attempted to
                  comfort her weeping partner. Every moment her
                  eyes grew brighter, &amp; her counter once more 
                  heavenly, &amp; she often said, " I think it will soon

                  "Amen!" and as often did she turn to her weeping

                  with great affection in her countenance: "We 
                  " meet again-- joyful words, we meet again."

                  to her husband, &amp; earnestly watched him drink,
                  &amp; then gently drew it to Sister Borland, signifying 
                  her desire that she likewise, should join in their
                  parting

                  parting feast of love. Under the impression
                  that she was near her end, she then said: "the 
                  conflict is nearly over--- bring the baby!" ---- bring 
                  the baby!"---   The dear little infant was brought in
                  and all un  conscious of the coming loss, presented 
                  to her dying mother. She kissed it eagerly, and 
                  gently ribbles its little arm with hand, as
                  it lay across its breast, doubtlely imploring for 
                  it, in silent fervour, the everlasting mercies
                  of her Saviour. After the baby was removed,
                  she had some sharp struggles: but about a
                  quarter  of an hour before the end , she looked up again 
                  with great animation in her contenance, &amp; exclaimed
                  Praise! Praise! &amp; she gave out the lines:
                  O may over imperfect song &amp; praises -
                  "Be well pleasing unto thee, Lord Jesus;---
                  "Say my peace I leave with you,---
                  "Amen, amen, be it so!"--- A short struggle 
                  ensured, after  which looking around with great 
                  solemnity she addressed the company in these 
                  impressive words: Their is an hour that must
                  "come to you all!"----   She did not speak very

                  distinctly after this, but her lips were seen 
                  to move, &amp; sometimes such whispers were
                  heard: "Dear Saviour-- Amen--Amen!--"
                  - About 3 O'clock  in the afternoon,a pang
                  seemed to seize her for a moment, &amp; her counten 
                  ance betokened pair, but when it ceased a beau
                  tiful smile spread over her face, &amp; her eye be 
                  came fixed. She leaned her head on sister 
                  Borlands shoulder, &amp; still retained the hand 
                  of her husband in affectionate recognition.
                  Thees in solemn stillness, her parting breath 
                  was watched , &amp; gently and insensibly did
                  she die away, &amp; her happy redeemed spirit 
                  went over into the arms of her saviour &amp; her 
                  God! Her pilgrimage had lasted 28 years &amp; 
                  4 months-- Her memory is sacred &amp; blessed

                  <p>She's now at next- In endless bliss-
                  Beholding Christ our Saviour:--
                  Our humble expectations in 
                  To  join her there forever
